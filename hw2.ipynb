Superior conveyed that they would charge $350 per truck and an additional $50 for each drop-off they manage.

    "\n",
    "To calculate the annual cost of DowChem's current strategy, we need to consider the following costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shipping Cost:** This includes the fixed cost of USD400 per shipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Holding Cost:** DowChem incurs a holding cost of 25% for each pound of chemical. We'll calculate this as a percentage of the annual consumption for each customer type and then sum them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Total Cost:** The sum of the shipping cost and the holding cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate these costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shipping Cost:\n",
    "\n",
    "   DowChem has 20 customers, and each customer is served individually. Therefore, the total annual shipping cost can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   For the small customers:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - There would be no full truckload shipments for these customers since their annual consumption is less than the truck's capacity. Therefore, each shipment would cost USD400.\n",
    "   - As they are 12 in number, the total cost would be USD400 x 12 = USD4,800.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For the medium customers:\n",
    "   - It would be necessary to dispatch at least two truckloads for these customers since their annual consumption is more than the truck's capacity. Therefore, each shipment would cost USD400.\n",
    "   - Each costumet would incur a cost of USD400 x 2 = USD800.\n",
    "   - As they are 6 in number, the total cost would be USD800 x 6 = USD4,800.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For the large customers:\n",
    "   - It would be necessary to dispatch at least four truckloads for these customers since their annual consumption is more than the truck's capacity. Therefore, each shipment would cost USD400.\n",
    "   - Each costumet would incur a cost of USD400 x 4 = USD1,600.\n",
    "   - As they are 2 in number, the total cost would be USD1,600 x 2 = USD3,200.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Therefore, the total shipping cost would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",

    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Holding Cost:\n",
    "\n",
    "   For each customer type (small, medium, and large), we calculate the annual holding cost based on their respective consumption. Then, we sum these costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - For small customers, as they are 12 in number, the total annual consumption would be 12,000 x 12 = 144,000 pounds. Therefore, the annual holding cost would be 25% of 144,000 x USD1 = USD36,000.\n",
    "   - For medium customers, as they are 6 in number, the total annual consumption would be 60,000 x 6 = 360,000 pounds. Therefore, the annual holding cost would be 25% of 360,000 x USD1 = USD90,000.\n",
    "   - For large customers, as they are 2 in number, the total annual consumption would be 144,000 x 2 = 288,000 pounds. Therefore, the annual holding cost would be 25% of 288,000 x USD1 = USD72,000.\n",

    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Total Cost:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Now, we sum up the shipping cost and the holding cost to get the total annual cost:\n",

    "Let's delve deeper into each of the options for DowChem's distribution strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Consolidating All Customers into One Truck\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delivery Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preparation:** All orders from the 20 customers are accumulated until there's enough demand to fill a truck.\n",
    "2. **Loading:** The truck is loaded up to its maximum capacity of 40,000 pounds. \n",
    "3. **Route Planning:** A delivery route is mapped out to service all 20 customers in the most efficient manner possible, ensuring that the travel time and distance are minimized.\n",
    "4. **Delivery:** The truck starts from the distribution center and makes its way to each of the 20 customers. At each stop, the precise amount of chemical needed by that customer is offloaded. This means the truck will make 20 different stops during its route.\n",
    "5. **Billing:** Superior Trucking Co. will bill DowChem $350 for the truck and an additional $50 for each of the 20 drop-offs. This amounts to a total of $1,350 for the entire route.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Grouping Customers into Two Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delivery Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Group Formation:** The 20 customers are divided into two groups. Each group consists of one large, three medium, and six small customers.\n",
    "2. **Preparation:** Orders from customers in each group are collected separately. When there's enough demand within a group to fill a truck, that group's truck is dispatched.\n",
    "3. **Loading:** Two trucks are loaded, each up to a maximum capacity of 40,000 pounds, based on the orders from their respective groups.\n",
    "4. **Route Planning:** For each truck, a delivery route is designed to service the 10 customers in its group efficiently.\n",
    "5. **Delivery:** Each truck starts from the distribution center and delivers to the 10 customers in its group. Every truck makes 10 stops.\n",
    "6. **Billing:** For each truck, Superior Trucking Co. will bill DowChem $350 plus $50 for each of the 10 drop-offs, totaling $850. Since there are two trucks, the combined cost for both routes will be $1,700.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 3: Aggregating Each Customer Type into One Truck\n",
    "\n",
    "**Delivery Process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Grouping by Type:** Customers are grouped based on their types—small, medium, and large.\n",
    "2. **Preparation:** Orders are collected from all customers of a specific type until there's enough demand to fill a truck for that type.\n",
    "3. **Loading:** Three separate trucks are loaded: one for small customers, one for medium customers, and one for large customers. Each truck is loaded up to its capacity based on the total orders from its specific customer type.\n",
    "4. **Route Planning:** Each truck has a delivery route mapped out to service customers of its type.\n",
    "5. **Delivery:** \n",
    "    - The truck for small customers will make 12 stops.\n",
    "    - The truck for medium customers will make 6 stops.\n",
    "    - The truck for large customers will make 2 stops.\n",
    "6. **Billing:** \n",
    "    - For the small customer truck, Superior Trucking Co. will bill $350 plus $50 x 12 = $600, totaling $950.\n",
    "    - For the medium customer truck, the bill will be $350 + $50 x 6 = $300, totaling $650.\n",
    "    - For the large customer truck, the bill will be $350 + $50 x 2 = $100, totaling $450.\n",
    "    - Combining all three trucks, the total cost will be $2,050."
