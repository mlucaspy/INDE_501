Superior charges a fixed fee of $400 for each shipment, irrespective of the quantity transported on the truck—from the distribution center to each customer.\n",

Nevertheless, John Smith, the Vice President of DowChem, is deeply concerned about the escalating distribution costs. John approached Superior to inquire about the possibility of consolidating shipments for multiple customers onto a single truck. Superior conveyed that they would charge $350 per truck and an additional $50 for each drop-off they manage. Consequently, if a single truck is used for a solitary delivery, the total charge would amount to $400. However, if a truck has to make four deliveries, the total charge would rise to $550.\n",

    "To calculate the annual cost of DowChem's current strategy, we need to consider the following costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shipping Cost:** This includes the fixed cost of USD400 per shipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Holding Cost:** DowChem incurs a holding cost of 25% for each pound of chemical. We'll calculate this as a percentage of the annual consumption for each customer type and then sum them up.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Shipping Cost:\n",
